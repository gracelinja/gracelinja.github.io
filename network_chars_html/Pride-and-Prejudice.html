<h2 align="center">Character Network</h2>
<center>
Inspired by <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/~abeverid/thrones.html">Network of Thrones</a>
</center>
<br><br>

The character network includes interacting characters in at least 5 scenes.<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>thickness</b> of links indicates the <>number of scenes</b> between the linked nodes/characters. Thicker line means more scenes.</li>
<li>The <b>color</b> of nodes indicates natural division of <b>communities</b>:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Community 1: MR BENNET, MARY, JANE, WICKHAM, ELIZABETH, KITTY, MRS BENNET, LYDIA</li>
<li>Community 2: COLLINS, MR COLLINS, CHARLOTTE</li>
<li>Community 3: MRS GARDINER, MR GARDINER</li>
<li>Community 4: BINGLEY, DARCY, CAROLINE BINGLEY</li>

	</ul>
</ul>

Additional Statistics:
<ul><li><b>Connected Components</b> : <font color="blue">[16]</font></li>
<li><b>Transitivity Ratio</b> : <font color="blue"> 0.504</font> (0 = one character connected to others; 1 = all characters connected to each other)</li>
<li><b>Local Clustering Coefficient</b> : <font color="blue"> 0.806</font></li>
<li><b>Density</b> : <font color="blue"> 0.325</font> (0 = no links; 1 = all possible links)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Character Importance</h2>
We use different centrality measures to address characters' influence. Higher value means higher influence.<br>
<br>

<img src="network_chars_importance_plots/Pride-and-Prejudice.png" width="100%"></img>

An explanation for the measures:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Degree Centrality:</b> the fraction of characters you interact with.</li>
	<li><b>Weighted Degree:</b> the number of interactions you participate in.</li>
	<li><b>Eigenvector Centrality:</b> weighted degree centrality with a feedback boost for interacting with other important characters. You get full credit for the importance of your neighbors.</li>
	<li><b>PageRank Centrality:</b> weighted degree centrality with a feedback boost for interacting with other important characters. The importance of your neighbors is split among its neighbors.</li>
	<li><b>Closeness Centrality:</b> how close you are to all other characters; it is the average shortest distance to all other characters (measured by number of links you traverse).</li>
	<li><b>Betweenness Centrality:</b> how often you lie on shortest paths between two other characters, making you a broker of information.</li>
</ul>

It seems that the standout character is <b>Elizabeth</b>,
who interacts the most with:
<ul>
	 <li>MRS BENNET 23</li>
	 <li>MR BENNET 19</li>
	 <li>JANE 19</li>
	 <li>DARCY 19</li>
	 <li>KITTY 16</li>
</ul>
-->

It seems that the stadout character is <b>ELIZABETH</b>, who has the most scenes with:
<ul>
<li>MRS BENNET 23</li>
<li>MR BENNET 19</li>
<li>JANE 19</li>
<li>DARCY 19</li>
<li>KITTY 16</li>
</ul>

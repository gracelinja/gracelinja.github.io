var categories = ["With five thousand a year, it would not matter if he had a big pink face.","Well, if every man in this room does not end the evening completely in love with you then I am no judge of beauty.","Oh, they are far too easy to judge.","Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.","And eat my hat. She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.","So which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?","And the person with the disagreeable expression?","Poor soul.","How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley?","The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country.","Do you dance Mr Darcy?","Don't worry. I would not dance with him for half of Derbyshire.","Yes! I adore her.","Mama!","And so ended their affection. I wonder who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love?","Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it is only a thin, slight sort of inclination, I'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely. Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of interest.","Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones partner is barely tolerable. She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He has no idea she heard him. He blushes.","Handsome, conveniently rich -","I agree entirely, only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony, which is why I will end up an old maid.","Jane, he danced with you most of the night.","That is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise. Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very amiable, and I give you leave to like him. You've liked many a stupider person.","You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes.","Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle.","Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's babbling.","Though I don't think, mama, you can reasonably take credit for making it rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her death before she gets there.","\"And my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better -- but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a. fever, and a headache there is nothing wrong with me.\" This is ridiculous.","Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother. Mr Bennet laughs.","I am going to Netherfield at once.","Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition.","I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about.","I'm so sorry. How is my sister?","Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.","Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.","Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently, it seems she is in better comfort here than she would be at home.","Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea.","i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.","I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold. Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to","And it's a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose. Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline Bingley turns to Darcy.","Our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.","We could always tease him.","Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider that a fault?","For we're trying to find a fault in you.","Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that. What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.","Jane, do you think you might feel well enough to leave today?","Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.","trying to stop Bingley being","Thank you, Mary.","Thank you for such stimulating company. It has been most instructive.","Mr Darcy.","Please, drive on.","Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study? Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.","Believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be practised. The girls look at one another.","Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.","Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled.","We've lost him. They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled hair. The perfect romantic hero.","Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them.","Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that.","So you don't mind being laughed at?","It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world.","You already owe me a considerable sum, Liddy.","No! Please - Mr Wickham! - Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter.","You're too generous.","It all adds up.","Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr Wickham?","About a month. Are you acquainted with, Mr Darcy?","As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable.","I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations.","Really I need to take some air. Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.","I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of.","I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?","How so?","If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him.","On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is.","No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor of the ball.","Have you seen Mr Wickham. She shakes her head.","Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth.","Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.","Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins.","That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.","You may. Darcy walks away.","What was I thinking? Have I no presence of mind?l","Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all - to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!","I do love a Sarabande.","It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.","That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent.","We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous.","Very mild weather we've been having.","Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.","He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?","To make out your character, Mr Darcy.","very little. The dancefinishes.","I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.","His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing,","I believe so.","But sir -","He is? Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards Darcy.","Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an","Aren't you going to do something?","Perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.","Yes. I think he likes her very much.","She is just shy and modest. If he does not perceive her regard he is a fool.","Mother. I really think it is time to go.","Really. This is enough. Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He turns and walks away.","Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me.that anybody need not hear.","Mr Collins -","You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer.","Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it.","Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.","Mr Collins -","Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth.","Thank you, papa. Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.","What's wrong, Jane? Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.","I don't understand. What would take him from Netherfield? Why would he not know when he was to return?","\"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgina Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishments, so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister. It is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self.\"","Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise.","He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to our aunt and uncle's in London.","Let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.","I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.","Thank you, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.","What news?","Engaged?","No, no...  Of course not.","No...","And that's all you expect?","Don't speak like that, Charlotte!","And we only have two choices?","You can still change your mind, Charlotte.","All of them?","It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go.","What's happened?","Has the pig escaped? Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.","I have not heard from Mr Wickham since the regiment left for Brighton, but I am informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does very well.","I am, your ladyship.","Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?","Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself.","Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that.  What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles.","They are, thank you.","A little, ma'am, and very poorly.","No, not at all.","Not one.","My mother would have no objection but my father hates London.","We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly.","Not at all, Lady Catherine.","Yes, ma'am. All.","Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.","With three younger sisters grown up, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to","No, I beg you -","Please, I told you I play poorly -","You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all your state to hear me, but I won't be alarmed even though your sister does play so well.","You really care to know? The colonel nods.","Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.","True, and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom.","Maybe you should take your aunt's advice and practice. Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck. She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.","Mr Darcy! An awkward pause.","Please, do be seated.","I believe so -- and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful","He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down.","Shall I call for some tea?","How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel?","I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.","Really?","What happened?","Who was the man?","Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?","What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?","So he separated them?","I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. 76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76 parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance.","Me?","I don't understand...","Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain. Believe me, it was unconsciously done. A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.","Yes, sir.","No?","I'm sure that the feelings which, as you've told me, have hindered your regard, will help you in overcoming it.","I might as well enquire why, with so. evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse -","But I have other reasons, you know I have!","Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the face.","Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind?","How could you do it?","Indifferent?","That's because she's shy!","Because you suggested it!","My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me!  I suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter?","What was?","Did my sister give that impression?","Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that!","How, sir?","And what about Mr Wickham?","What excuse can you give for your behavior to him?","He told me of his misfortunes.","You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm?","My pride?","And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.","I was caught somewhat off-guard.","No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.","I do not know. I hardly know myself. Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.","How is Jane? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.","oh Jane...","Nothing. Everything as you might imagine. Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and Mrs Bennet.","Kitty, what's happened?","Please Papa, don't let her go!","If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does.","Peace! Is that all you care about?","Father, its dangerous! -","No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst.","I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life.","Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever.","No, they bring nothing but heartache.","I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.","No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister.","I would rather stay here.","I must own that I'm tired of great houses. All those carpets and curtains.","If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am sure I will not be able to bear it.","I hear that Pemberley is not far from here.","You see something of the owner, do you, in town?","Only a little.","They are at home?!","I thought you were in London.","No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.","I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt.","Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.","Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand.","I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.","Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.","Goodbye, Mr Darcy.","To dine with him?","His sister?","What a beautiful instrument.","Your brother is well, I trust?","Yes, the library is particularly splendid, is it not? A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation, approaches.","Yes, very.","It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her.","You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days.","It does you credit, sir.","107 Its from Jane. 10 she rips open the letter.","It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever.","No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.","Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope.","Sir, it think it is too late.","He hasn't found him yet, Mama.","How long is this going to go on for?","I can't bear not hearing anything.","Oh father, I'm so sorry.","You mustn't be too severe on yourself.","Give it to me.","They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition.","You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls.","Ah, I see.","Do you think it a large sum?","We should thank our uncle, Mama.","How can you talk like that? Her mother gets to her feet.","Is that all you think about?","You don't know what he's like","Lydia!","I don't want to hear -","Can't you understand why?","Mr Darcy?","Mr Darcy was at your wedding?","I met Mr Darcy's sister.","Very much.  We found a great deal to talk about.","Why was Mr Darcy there?","Please, Lydia!","For what?","Everything?","But why did he do it?","That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.","Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr Bingley?","Are you well, Mr Darcy?","Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport.","So soon?","Oh yes? Jane, take care.","I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.","Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I been in love, I could not have been more blind!","How did he account for it?","Unfathomable.","Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.","Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time. What is that? More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each other.","Lady Catherine! Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast Bennets.","Indeed you are mistaken. I can not account for this honour at all.","If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.","Your coming here will be rather a confirmation, surely, if indeed such a report exists.","I have never heard of it.","I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer.","Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible.","Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.","I am not.","I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside.","Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed.","For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.","Mr Darcy!","I could not sleep.","Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also.","I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate.","Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned.","No, Papa.","Have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference?","I do like him!","No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it.","Very much. He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no doubt.","Oh thank you! She starts to rush out.","How did it begin?","Now be sincere, did you admire me for my impertinenc?","You may as well call it impertinence, though make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible. And, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe... and I shall begin directly... We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter and fainter, the sound of music and laughter..."];
